### Scenev2.py - <i> PyOpenGL </i>
    python3 scenev2.py 


### Scenev3.py - <i>PyOpenGL (uses numpy and pygame libraries) </i>
    python3 scenev3.py 
    
    Use your mouse to navigate the scene. Pressing the p key pauses the scene. Pressing 
    the p key a second time allows navigation to resume. Pressing esc or return exits 
    the program. 
    
### Note
    Appx. Time Taken: Around 6 hours
    I would like to combine the two together, to ideally create a more detailed, 
    holographic flamingo in water. Combining the mouse/keyboard functions from 
    scene3.py into scene2.py will allow for a much more complex object and interaction.

### Necessary Libraries: <br>
    PyOpenGL
    numpy
    pygame 

### Install using the following terminal commands: 
    pip install PyOpenGL
####
    pip install numpy
