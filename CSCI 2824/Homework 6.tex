\noindent This assignment is due on Friday, February 28 to Gradescope by 11:59pm.  You are expected to write up your solutions neatly and \textbf{use the coverpage}.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss problems with your classmates, but you must work and write your solutions on your own. 

{\bf Important}: On the {\bf official CSCI 2824 cover page} of your assignment clearly write your full name, the lecture section you belong to (001 or 002), and your student ID number.  You may \textbf{neatly} type your solutions for +2 extra credit on the assignment. You will lose \textit{all} 5 style/neatness points if you fail to use the official cover page.

% Set Properties
%==============================================================================
\item In an in-class example, we observed anecdotally that for non-empty sets $P, Q,$ and $R$, the following holds: $$(P \cap Q) \times R = \left( P \times R\right) \cap \left( Q \times R\right)  $$
	\be
		\item Prove that $(P \cap Q) \times R = \left( P \times R\right) \cap \left( Q \times R\right)  $ holds by showing that each side of this equation is a subset of the other side of the equation.
		\item Prove that that $(P \cap Q) \times R = \left( P \times R\right) \cap \left( Q \times R\right)  $ holds using \textbf{set builder} notation and using set identities.

% Recurrences
%==============================================================================
\item Complete the following recurrence exercises:
	\be
	\item Find a closed form of the recurrence given by $a_n=7\cdot  a_{n-1}-5;\, a_0=4$
	\item Find a closed form of the recurrence given by $a_n=(n+1)^2\cdot  a_{n-1};\, a_0=1$
	\item Consider the recurrence $a_n=a_{n-1}+2a_{n-2}+2n-9.$
		\be
		\item Show that this recurrence is solved by $a_n=2-n$.
		\item Show that this recurrence is solved by $a_n=2-n+b\cdot2^n$ for any real $b$.

%==============================================================================
% Functions: 1-1, Onto, etc.
%==============================================================================
\item Consider the function $f: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ given by $f(n,m)=\frac{n^3}{|m|+1}$
	\be
	\item Write in logical predicate notation - using quantifiers for $n$, $m$, etc. as appropriate - the logical equivalent of the function $f$ being onto.
	\item Determine whether or not $f$ is one-to-one.
	\item Determine whether or not $f$ is onto.

%==============================================================================
% Onto and 1-1, as sets
%==============================================================================
\item Define the set $C=$ the set of all Spring 2020 CSCI2824 students.
\be
\item Define in words a function $f: C \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$.  Is the function function one-to-one and/or onto? Be sure that $f$ is actually a function, and feel free to be creative!
\item Again define the set $C=$ the set of all Spring 2020 CSCI2824 students.  Define in words another function $g: C \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$, but ensure that $g$ is definitely one-to-one.

% Alg complexity intro
%==============================================================================	
\item The given code attempts to answer the popular debate: ``which Jedi wins in a duel?"  \\
	%\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{JediCode}\\
	The code:
	\be
	\item[i)] Makes sure the inputs - Jedi names, lightsaber colors, and current topographic information - are the same sizes.
	\item[ii)] Pairs up Jedi within a couple of for loops
	\item[iii)] Checks if Jedi \#1 is Mace or if Jedi \#2 is Mace. He always wins in these debates.
	\item[iv)] Checks which Jedi is currently at the highest elevation.  After all, the high ground wins!
	\ee
	You, aspiring Jedi enthusiast, must answer:
	\be
	\item What is the \textbf{algorithmic complexity} of this code?  In other words, exactly how comparisons are checked if $n$ Jedi are input correctly?  You may assume that \textit{each} part of the \textbf{if, elif, else} statement does in fact generate a comparison regardless of input, as this is a ``worst-case" analysis.
	\item What are some redundancies of this code?  Could it be done in less comparisons?
	\item (Not for points): In your opinion, what should actually have been used to determine the winners?
