\noindent This assignment is due on Friday, Mar 13 to Gradescope by 11:59pm.  You are expected to write up your solutions neatly and \textbf{use the coverpage}.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss problems with your classmates, but you must work and write your solutions on your own. 

{\bf Important}: On the {\bf official CSCI 2824 cover page} of your assignment clearly write your full name, the lecture section you belong to (001 or 002), and your student ID number.  You may \textbf{neatly} type your solutions for +2 extra credit on the assignment. You will lose \textit{all} 5 style/neatness points if you fail to use the official cover page.

\item The following are riffs on exam one questions that many students struggled with.
	\be
		\item Name two domains - with the same domain for both $x$ and $y$ - such that \textit{both} the statements $\forall x \exists y \left(x^2 \geq y \right) $ and $\exists x \forall y \left(x^2 > y \right) $ are \textbf{true}?  Next, name two domains - with the same domain for both $x$ and $y$ - such that \textit{both} the statements $\forall x \exists y \left(x^2 \geq y \right) $ and $\exists x \forall y \left(x^2 > y \right) $ are \textbf{false}?
		\item Suppose sets $A$ and $B$ satisfy $A \cup B = A$.  What can you conclude about sets $A$ and $B$?  Explain.
		\item Suppose sets $A$ and $B$ satisfy $A-B=A$.  What can you conclude about sets $A$ and $B$?  Explain.

% Matrix Multipliction
%==============================================================================

\item  Consider the following matrices. \\\\
$A=\begin{bmatrix} 1&4\\ 1&1\\ 1&4\\ 1&1 \end{bmatrix}$
$B=\begin{bmatrix} 2&2&2&1\\ 1&1&1&2\end{bmatrix}$ and 
$C=\begin{bmatrix} 1&1\\ 2&2\\ 1&1\\ 2&0\end{bmatrix}$\\\\\\
For this problem, we will calculate product $P=ABC$. Note that matrix multiplication is associative, which means we can calculate the product $P$ by first computing the matrix $(AB)$, then multiplying this by $C$ to obtain $P=(AB)C$. \textbf{Or} we could first compute the matrix $(BC)$, then multiply it by A to obtain $P=A(BC)$. Now recall that to multiply an $m\times n$ matrix by an $n\times k$ matrix requires $m\times n\times k$ \textit{multiplications}.\\
	\be
		\item Suppose $A$ is $m\times n$, $B$ is $n\times k$ and $C$ is $k\times p$. How many multiplications are needed to calculate $P$ in the order $(AB)C$? Do not just write down an expression; show your work/justification!
		\item For the same matrix dimensions specified in (a), how many multiplications are needed to calculate P in the order $A(BC)$? Again, do not just write down an expression.
		\item Based on the specific dimensions of $A$, $B$, and $C$ in the problem description, which multiplication order would be the most efficient?
		\item Calculate $P=ABC$ using whichever order you specified in part (c).

% Induction 1
%==============================================================================
\item Use induction to show that $\sum_{i=0}^n i^3= \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}$.
Be sure to state whether you're using weak or strong induction.

%==============================================================================
% Induction 2
%==============================================================================
\item Let $A_1, A_2, \dots A_n$ be sets.  Use induction to show that for $n \geq 2$, the cardinality of the union of $n$ sets is always less than or equal to the sum of the cardinalities of those sets.  In other words, show:
$$\left| \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| \leq \sum_{i=1}^n \left|A_i \right| $$
Be sure to state whether you're using weak or strong induction.\\  Hint: use the same rule that HW 4 \#6 was based around.
